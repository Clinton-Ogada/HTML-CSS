<h1 id="top"> Story in the Book</h1>
 <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
 <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about 
 an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies 
 of <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and all 
 the other scientific journals her work had 
 appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On 
 The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favorite book 
 since college, and the longer she spent in these 
 four walls the more she felt she needed to be 
 free.</p>
 <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room, 
 sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote 
 proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of 
 people who have nothing better to do</q>. Although 
 many considered her pioneering work, unraveling 
 the secrets of the llama <abbr 
 title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an 
 outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think 
 she had something better to do.</p>

 <p>Before we continue, consider buying the book</p>
